    <h4>
      In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
      usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of
      a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth,
      plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In
      wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are
      also trees.

      <h2>HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR TREES</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Although there will be times when you will need an arborist, you can do
      lots to help your trees stay in good, healthy condition and increase their
      longevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular deep watering: it is the irreplaceable trees in your garden that
      you should water during prolonged droughts. When the soil is at optimum
      moisture, a large, leafy tree can transpire up to 200 litres a day. A
      long, slow soaking is the best way to water, at a pace the soil can easily
      absorb.
    </p>
    <p>
      the root zone: it is tempting to use the shade of a big tree for parking
      on a hot, sunny day, but if you do it regularly, you will be permanently
      damaging its root zone. Plant roots need to breathe so there must be space
      for oxygen in the soil. The weight of a car, and even repeated foot
      traffic, can compact the soil, causing roots to die and the tree to
      suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep climbers off the bark: even though most climbers are not parasitic,
      as they wrap around or attach themselves to a tree (especially ivy), they
      build up moisture and debris close to the trunk, causing fungal
      infections. Eventually, this, or just the weight of the climbing plant,
      can destroy the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not attach ropes or stays to a tree: even a padded rope with an
      attached weight, such as a well-used swing or hammock, crushes the main
      feeding tubes that lie just under the bark, damaging the limb.
    </p>

      <h3>ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY GARDENING</h3>
    </header>
    <h4>1. Go Native</h4>
    <p>
      One of the best ways to attract wildlife to your garden is to fill it with
      as many native plants as possible. Native wildflowers are easy to grow and
      maintain, and are often more resistant to pests than non-natives. They are
      also ideal for attracting bees and butterflies, which need all the help
      they can get with numbers declining across the country.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Grow your own food</h4>
    <p>
      Why not devote a patch of your garden to growing your own food? It’s
      cheaper, reduces your environmental impact and tastes that little bit
      better knowing you’ve grown it yourself. You can grow plenty of foods, be
      it vegetables like carrots and potatoes or fruit such as apples and
      berries. Cherry and crab apple are just two of the native trees you could
      plant to grow your own fruit.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Make your own fertilizer</h4>
    <p>
      Natural leaf mould is just one way to make your own fertilizer. You can
      use everything from leftover food to pulled-up weeds and grass cuttings to
      create a natural means of helping your garden grow. Soaking weeds in a
      container for a few weeks creates a nutrient-rich solution that can be
      used to water plants. You can also try "grass-cycling", which involves
      leaving grass trimmings on the lawn after mowing, providing a natural
      fertilizer.
